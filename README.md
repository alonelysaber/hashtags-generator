# hashtags-generator
For content creators, to make your hashtag process more fluent
Simply enter the hashtags you want in your content with spaces between them and the program will generate a clean set of strings with hashtags neatly placed between each individual word.
This program also uses the pyperclip package to copy the text to your clipboard so you can easily post it directly.
